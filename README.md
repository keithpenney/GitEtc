## Git notes and anything else that might be handy
### Header level 3, btw.

This is also a good opportunity to *include some GitHub-flavored markdown* as a quick reference for my **future self**.  It's less verbose than ~~HMTL~~ ~~HTLM~~ HTML and YAML, but as someone once said:
>Keith doesn't know anything about YAML.

**Bold** and *italics* can use __asterisks__ \* or _underlines_ \_ (as long as they match).

Links are nice and easy.  [Learn More About Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

Tables Are | Also Nice and | Easy
-----------|---------------|-----
Just | add some | text between
vertical bars | | and 
line breaks. | Empty cells | are ok!

## Code Formatting and Syntax Highlighting!

Code snippets can be written `<inline>` or
```
as their own block.
```

```python
# Python
def foo(bar):
    if bar:
        return true
    return false
```

```c++
// C++
int main() {
    std::cout << "Language-specific highlighting!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

```verilog
// Verilog
module Adder(A, B, Sum, Carry);
  input A, B;
  output Sum, Carry;
  assign Sum = A ^ B;
  assign #5 Carry = A & B;
endmodule
```
